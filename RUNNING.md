Note: in order for the attack to work you must open the website in
Firefox and please have your browser window fill up the whole screen. If you would like to see
what is happening behind the scenes, you can simply inspect the page (right click -> inspect), 
find the iframe component (likely have to scroll up a little to find the element) and modify 
the opacity of the iframe. Once the iframe is visible, you can play around with refreshing the page
to see how the buttons change location, therefore preventing an attack.
